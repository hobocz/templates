### A collection of templates for various Python functionality. These scripts were created with:
[python 3.10.6, pandas 1.5.1, numpy 1.23.4, matplotlib 3.6.2] 
They have undergone basic testing in both Windows and Linux systems.

These are simple templates and examples, and are *not meant to display complex
functionality*. They are only meant to be starting points, and to demonstrate
things like coding style and thoroughness.
Some of the functionality represented:
- pandas, numpy and matplotlib
- multiprocessing
- data classes
- docstrings
- type hinting
- decorators
- pathlib
- argparse
- logging

Note: More rigorous testing should be performed as there are certainly
some environments, parameters, etc, that were not accommodated and may
uncover issues.
